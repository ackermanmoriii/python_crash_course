[SOUND] Welcome

at our MOOC lecture
series on Econometrics.

The topic of this lecture
is Simple Regression, and

in particular, its motivation.

In this introductory lecture, we will
consider a simple example concerning

the weekly sales of a product with a price
that can be set by the store manager.

We expect that lower prices
lead to higher sales.

The econometrician tries
to quantify the magnitude

of these consumer reactions
to such price changes.

This helps the store manager
to decide to increase or

decrease the price if the goal is to
maximize the turnover for this product.

Turnover is sales times price.

In our example, we have two years
of weekly data, that is,

104 observations on sales and prices.

And the histogram of the sales
data look like this.

You can see that the majority of weekly
sales are somewhere in between 90 and

95 units, with a minimum of 86
and a maximum of 98.

Sales of 92 and 93 units are most
often observed, each 19 times.

The store manager can freely decide
each week on the price level,

presented on the next slide.

This histogram shows that
prices vary from 51 to 57,

with a median price of 54 and
an average price also close to 54.

When we plot sales against price
that occur in the same week,

we get the following scatter diagram.

Note, that the number of points in this
diagram is less than 104 because some

weeks have identical values
for price and sales.

You can observe that
higher prices associate,

in general, with lower sales and
lower prices with higher sales.

You can also see this in this table,
where lower prices are associated

with higher sales at
the left part of the table.

If we change the points in the original
scatter into the average sales data,

we see that the line connecting
the average values is roughly linear.

And when we go back to the scatter
diagram, we see that a straight

line can be fitted reasonably well
to the points in this diagram.

The actual sales are the dots, and
the predicted sales are on the line.

A given price does not always
associate with the same sales level,

as there are other factors that
also cause variation in sales.

For example, the weekly number of
customers who do their shopping

in this store will influence sales.

The observed data are reasonably
close to the line, but

they do not lie exactly on it.

For a given price and a given line,
predicted sales is equal to the value of

�a� plus �b� times Price.

We denote the difference
between the actual sales and

the predicted sales by the residual e.

The coefficient b measures the slope
or marginal effect,

that is, the change in sales when
the price changes with one unit.

When the slope is equal to zero,

this corresponds to observations,
for example, like this.

For such data there does not seem to be
any relationship between sales and price.

Going back to the original
scatter diagram,

the values of the coefficients a and
b are of interest to the store manager

as they offer the opportunity to
predict sales for a given price.

This helps to set a new price
if sales are felt as too low.

The histogram of sales would just
suggest a prediction of around 92

or 93 units, as this is the mean
value of the weekly sales data.

However, from the scatter
plot of sales and price data,

you see that different price levels
associate with different sales levels.

And this suggests that you can
use the price to predict sales.

To summarize, the linear equations
Sales is �a� plus �b� times Price, allows

us to predict the effects of a price cut
that the store manager did not try before,

or to estimate the optimal
price to maximize turnover.

Now I invite you to consider
the following test question.

Suppose you are interested to find
the price that maximizes turnover,

where turnover is defined as
the product of Price and Sales.

How can you find that
price from the relation

Sales is �a� + �b� times Price?

The answer is as follows.

As turnover is Price times Sales,
or �a� times P plus �b� times P-squared,

the derivative of turnover with
respect to price is equal to a + 2 bP.

Setting this equal to 0 gives
an optimal price of -a / 2b.

In our lectures on simple regression,

we focus on two variables of interest we
denote by y and x, where one variable, x,

is thought to be helpful
to predict the other, y.

This helpful variable x we
call the regressor variable or

the explanatory factor.

And the variable y that we want to
predict is called the dependent variable,

or the explained variable.

The histogram of our sales data
may suggest that the sales

distribution can be approximated
by a normal distribution.

A simple way of summarizing
the 104 observations on sales

is written as shown on the slide.

This notation means that the observations
of sales are considered to be

independent draws from the same
Normal distribution, with mean mu and

variance sigma squared,
abbreviated as NID.

Note that we use the Greek letters
mu and sigma squared for

parameters that we do not know and that we
want to estimate from the observed data.

The probability distribution of sales
is described by just two parameters,

the mean and the variance.

On this slide you see the graph of
a standardized normal distribution with

mean 0 and variance 1.

And if you wish,
you can consult the Building Blocks for

further details on
the normal distribution.

For a normal distribution with mean mu,
the best prediction for

the next observation on sales
is equal to that mean mu.

An estimator of the population mean
mu is given by the sample mean,

where y subscript i denotes
the i-th observation on sales.

The sample mean is called an unconditional
prediction of sales, as it does not

depend on any other variable.

In many cases,

it helps to use additional
information to improve the prediction.

In our example,

price may help to predict sales because
lower prices will lead to higher sales.

There are four more lectures
in this set to come.

Lecture 1.2 introduces the
simple regression model, and

Lecture 1.3 shows how you can find
the regression line from the actual data.

We will also show how you can evaluate
the accuracy of the regression outcomes.

In Lecture 1.4 we will examine which
statistical assumptions support the use

of the simple regression model and

what are the consequences when some
of these assumptions are not met.

The required modifications
provide the motivation for

the other lectures of this MOOC,

that all consist of extensions of
the basic ideas of simple regression.

And finally,

Lecture 1.5 provides some illustrations
of the use of simple regression.

The modules 2 through 6 of this MOOC
provide various extensions, but

the simple regression model provides
the fundamental basis.

And here is another test for you to make,
which deals with the variation of

points around the imaginary line and
the quality of your predictions.

The correct answer is diagram B,

because this diagram has smallest
variation around the imaginary line.

For a given price level,
the range of potential forecasts for

sales is smallest for case B.

So here you may expect to
make better predictions.

Now I invite you to make
the training exercise,

where you can train yourself with the
topics that were treated in this lecture.

You can find this exercise on the website.

And this concludes our first
lecture on Simple Regression.
